# Advent of Code 2023
My working and solutions for [Advent of Code 2023]([url](https://adventofcode.com/)https://adventofcode.com/)

Strategy: I'm gonna keep it relatively simple this year as I [won't have much time]([url](https://mtqoi.github.io/baby_stats/)) to spend learning a new language or framework. 
I'll stick to base Python as much as possible and just try to force myself to face the problems differently to how I'd normally think. Solutions won't be 'optimal' or 'elegant' but like I've said before I'm a big fan of quick-and-dirty, working solutions.
